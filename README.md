# Starting point for building react apps
I've created this template because I wanted to speed-up the process of making new vite app. This template allows me to use my stack out-of-the-box, without thinkink about the right dependency every time I start a new project.

This template comes with default setup for:
- React + Router + Redux Toolkit
- Thunks + Axios
- My eslint + prettier setup
- Material UI
- Jest
